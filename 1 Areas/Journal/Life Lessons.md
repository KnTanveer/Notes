### Avoid

- Never participate in a comp you know you will lose 

Today was 26 jan republic day our society event I participated in running race (which I didn't last year as I was scared and knew I would lose) but this year I was like you know what let's face the fear and I ran I don't know why I ran very weirdly and of course I came last but adi said why were you running so weird and I didn't bothered much just discussed about improvement but taiba  said me afterwards that "why did you ran when you knew you will not to be able to do so and everyone was laughing" that was a breakthrough for me I was shocked and ashamed of myself

  

### Win Friends

How to win friends and not influence people 

- Experiment with different groups
- They should recognize you in a crowd 
- Don't expect anything in return 

  
It's okay to search a group that you fit in and if you can't find one It's okay to be alone  
  
Socially, we see that close friendships are the bedrock of our psychological and physical health.
