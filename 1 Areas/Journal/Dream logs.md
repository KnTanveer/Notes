SAND HOUSE DREAM (MIITTI KA GHAR WALA SAPNA)

I found this in my apple notes Inbox which used earlier
Meko thode din pehle Sapna aaya tha ki hum log ek Jan Kai Ghar Pai gai Thai aur
unlog ne apna Ghar sirf mitti ka banaya Tha bin sari ya Kai aur boht taarif Kar
Rahe the pgir thodi Der baat Mai aur taiba niche utrai aur sab Ghar Mai hi the
hum log ne gadi jalu Kiya aur race diya galti Sai gadi piche ho gayi aur thuk
gai aur u ka Ghar gir pada

I had a dream tonight I don't know why this girl from my class she was the cr of our class keeps showing up in my dream or so 
I don't like her she is average though 
I had talked to her like I didn't went and talked to her about anything but like in practical exams we very besides each other so

So the dream was like we all were in a class there was some random discussion going on and I just said i don't care about my marks (I said something like this) and this girl said why are you dumb or fool And I just ran downstairs and this girl was running behind me and saying tell me what do you mean explain me and we got two three floors down then I decided to stop and tell her but the floor was crowded I told her to come a floor down with through my hand gestures And in between the staircase a teacher caught us the teacher was my XI grade class teacher (although doesn't acted liked she knew me but the face was same like she was it) then teacher stopped us we sat down on the stairs than the teacher asked and I told that she is running behind me and teacher asked whose keyboard is this which was in her bag or box like thing and it was mine (I wanted to buy potronics hydra 10 desperately at this time) and somehow the dream ended

But the point why I wrote this is the dream felt normal but after waking up and after sheri analyzing it gave me some pure romantic feelings And I don't know why this XII std class representative comes to my dream Deepali 
She is just smaller than my height not to small she has short hairs like till her shoulders she is talkative and studies to get good grades she is fair enough and is from south
