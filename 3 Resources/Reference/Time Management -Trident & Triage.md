#### Triage system
The order in which you do things matters more than how many things you got done
**Triage to do it with priority** 

The problem is not that we have too much to do, The problem is that we are trying to do everything
In a world where To-Do lists are literally infinitely long it's physically impossible to get through the to do list 
Triage - showing up everyday and doing things with priority 

##### The daily reset
The box method - *create* a box, *slash* when you have kind of start the task, then *half shade* the task, and the *fill it and cross out*

##### Real-Time Triage
To do the most important things first
every moment adding tasks and re-prioritizing
Eisenhauer matrix

##### The ward round protocol 
> Projects and quests
> 	arranged in priority 

1. project status through 
- Hold: ðŸ”µ
- Not started/planning:ðŸŸ 
- Doing: ðŸŸ¢
- Done: ðŸŸ£

2. every single project should have the next action step

##### Intentional Incompletion
taking breaks by understanding there will always be something to do 

##### The 2-for-1 hour 
early hours have better quality 
	like before 9 will  be better than after 17

#### why google calendar & tasks
problem with notion calendar and Todoist
1. It's confusing that were to actually see our day plan calendar or task
2. Todoist need heavy maintenance and you will never be fulfilled with it 
3. It pushes planning to tasks side *which I don't want* Instead I want a calendar approach (which google does better)
4. More power more complex structure more draining and I tend to do useless stuffs which can't be done in google tasks
